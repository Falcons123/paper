#Introduction
We present air craft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using PCASP (Blogs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region , but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made. 
A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent 

#Simulations
We simulate the eveolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from source region

#Methodology
we compared out measurements of particle aging with a model simulation.
The model is detailed in smith et al 2002.
